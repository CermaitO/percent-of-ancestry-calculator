    <h1>Percent of Ancestry Calculator</h1>
    <p>
      How much of your ancestry does a particular ancestor account for? Enter
      your ancestors relationship with you, such as great grandparent or great x
      13 grandparent etc, and the amount of your ancestry from this ancestor
      will be calculated
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that this does NOT calculate how much of your DNA is from this
      person. Only a DNA test could tell you that. This simply measures how much
      of your ancestry, not DNA, comes from this person.
